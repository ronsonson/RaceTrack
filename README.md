# Race-Track
A simple OpenGL program with a race car going around a track


This program was made as the final project for my Computer Graphics class at Oregon State University. All of the boilerplate code was provided to me, but the core program was all done myself. This includes the keytime animation, basic lighting, and the general scene rendering. I also implemented hotkeys to change the view and lighting while running the program.



In order to run the program I reccomend using Visual Studio 2022. After cloning, open the sample.sln file with Visual Studio. First build the program then you can run from the Visual Studio debug menu.

A few screenshots of the program running:

While running the program there a couple of hotkeys to change the scene: 

You can hit 'L' to toggle the lights from the streetlamps on/off. 

You can hit 'B' to toggle between an aerial view and a view from the bleachers

You can also hit 'P' to view in perspective mode, or 'O' to view in orthographic mode. 

You can rotate the scene by left clicking with your mouse and dragging.

You can also right click to bring up a menu to adjust settings.
